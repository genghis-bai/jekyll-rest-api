This feature would make it easier toretrieve it back using a small keyword in your currently open feeds, withoutstarting a complete new search incorporating a new haystack of other irrelevantarticles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the press of a letter, the entire interface would refine it’s display ofarticles to the matching keyword.  &lt;/p&gt;",

VIM is a famous tool for editing code, butonly a few know the power it holds for text editing. The greatest thing aboutVIM is that you must control every move with your keyboard shortcuts (nomouse!), which forces your brain to train your muscle memory to become a magicwand over your text. You only have to think it, and your content has alreadychanged. VIM is coincidentally also one of the most hated programs of all timedue to its steep learning curve. But for those who love VIM, we love itvehemently for the power and speed that it brings to our coding. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;haters&quot;&gt;Haters&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;I&amp;#39;vebeen using Vim for about 2 years now, mostly because I can&amp;#39;t figure out howto exit it.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; I Am Devloper (@iamdevloper) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/iamdevloper/status/435555976687923200&quot;&gt;February 17,2014&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;lovers-include-tim-oreilly-and-ycombinators-paul-graham&quot;&gt;Lovers include Tim O’Reilly and YCombinator’s Paul Graham&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-cards=&quot;hidden&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;30 years on,Vi/Vim is still one of my all-time favorite computer power tools &lt;a href=&quot;http://t.co/Thz0ChX6eo&quot;&gt;http://t.co/Thz0ChX6eo&lt;/a&gt; Old dog, can stilllearn new tricks&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Tim O&amp;#39;Reilly (@timoreilly) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/timoreilly/status/582914712699998210&quot;&gt;March 31,2015&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eventually VIM’s keyboard shortcuts will make the distance between your brain’sthought and your screen frictionless so you will see how verbose your monkey-mindbecomes on paper. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To demonstrate what I mean, I created a few recordings of my favourite VIMmuscle memories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;toggle-lists-to-sentences&quot;&gt;Toggle lists to sentences&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just by selecting the text and pressing &lt;code&gt;,l&lt;/code&gt; I can convert a list of words in asentence to a bulleted list, and the other way around.

Our team’s hard work was then awardedby the top awards in the business like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accenture&quot;&gt;Accenture&lt;/a&gt; Innovation Awards andthe &lt;a href=&quot;http://pioneers.io/festival2015&quot;&gt;Pioneers&lt;/a&gt; festival. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m incredibly proud to have not only programmed an excellent product thatworks seamlessly, but also that Owlin has  received so much public recognition,and has reached the state of a profitable startup. I’m beyond confident in thefuture success of Owlin, as I’m leaving the company in the incredibly competenthands of my co-founders.  &lt;br /&gt;After working on the core technology behind Owlin for more than 5 years, I haveseen Owlin grow from my own pet project as a mere teen, to a self-sustainingcompany - serving the most in-depth, and fastest news analysis to the greatesthedge funds, banks, and accountants in the world.&lt;br /&gt;When I was programming at the age of 14, I imagined a dream job that wouldallow me the opportunity to build a profitable business for in-depth analysisof big data. Now that I have reached my goal, I have decided to move on tofollow even greater dreams. I will now hone my skills in programming in otherindustries to gain an even wider skill-set. Again, I’m only 22. Steve Jobs andLarry Page weren’t even started at this age. I’ve got a lot more to learn, andaccomplish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;col-md-6 pull-right&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/owlin/newsroom.gif&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Owlin I headed the development of our product by spearheading Agile/Scrummanagement for our team. I also set up real-time big data filtering pipelinesusing a custom algorithm developed in-part by our Data Scientist and residentQuantum physicist, Dr. Westra. I then visualized this data into a beautiful anduser-friendly interface using HTML5/CSS3 through websockets. I’m specificallyproud of Owlin’s database that is expanding at a monthly speed of 25Terabytes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As you can see, I seek out challenges, and make it my mission to solve them. Asa full-stack developer with an intense passion for learning and growth, I’mready to move on to the next adventure and continue to increase my strengths.I feel very privileged to have had the opportunity to sell most of my shares tomy co-founders. In the future, I will look into Angel Investing with my FutureVentures foundation to help other startups to get started in the rightdirection, and will stay involved with Owlin as a permanent advisor.

From the rise of mobile and touch-screentechnology, to communication-enhancing apps like Twitter, and Whatsapp, we’vecome a long way in a very short timeframe.  &lt;br /&gt;It’s my personal mission to extend humankind’s ability to communicate bycontinually innovating upon the latest technologies. In my opinion, the abilityto communicate and share one’s knowledge is truly a multiplier of successtowards a future world of increasing progress.&lt;br /&gt;With Owlin, my goal was to top Bloomberg by getting a 360 degree news view toour clients &lt;a href=&quot;/fast-news&quot;&gt;faster than any other service&lt;/a&gt;. I’m still enraptured by the ideaof optimizing the transferral of knowledge, and communication’s ability totransform society for the better. Let’s see how far this rabbit hole goes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As you can see, I have big plans.

Back in the days when the keyboard was invented, &lt;em&gt;name&lt;/em&gt; had put allletters on the keyboard in alphabetical order on the keyboard. When he startedtyping, his letterpresses got stuck because some of them were often shortlyused together. Therefor he placed them in a random order on the keyboard, andthe keys hitting each other together weren’t stuck anymore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You probably already knew this, from that question back in the days why thekeys weren’t placed in alphabetical order. But you probably didn’t know thatthere was no logical sense in that order. They were truely randomly placedwithout any science or thought behind it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr Querty sold his patents to a different company, and in the end, he never hadthe opportunity anymore to change the layout to a more efficient layout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;there-the-hero-came-in-antony-dvorak&quot;&gt;There the hero came in, Antony Dvorak&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;100&lt;/em&gt; years later after the “invention” of Querty, Mr Dvorak was a professor at &lt;em&gt;university&lt;/em&gt;, and wanted to fix this problem for humanity. He designed akeyboard that makes you type 100-600% faster than a regular Querty keyboard.After all, that keyboard was random, so there must be a lot of space forimprovement.After a number of studies, he had proven that people whom have never typed on akeyboard before, were faster in learning Dvorak, because it appeared to be morenatural, and had &lt;em&gt;insert speed improvement&lt;/em&gt; more words per minute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But for those already used to Querty, it is an amazingly frustrating progressto get into Dvorak typing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;federal-government-lets-test-this-dvorak-thingy&quot;&gt;Federal Government: Lets test this Dvorak thingy!&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;To end the discussion about this typewriter design once and for all, wetested it and it was &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; faster. - Fedz&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a research team, they did some tests, and Dvorak didn’t seem to result asignificant higher outcome than the Querty layout. Many on the internet believethis result was biased &lt;em&gt;insert citation&lt;/em&gt;, and I can believe than, knowing theanger and frustration looking for keys on a foreign keyboard where they’re allplaced differently.Even if they were actually right, I think they didn’t take account of the factthat Querty might have lower performance boundaries than Querty.So after long practice, you will actually be able to type faster than Querty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is proven by the many answers people have given on the internet ofco-progressives who took the courage to switch to the sense making. &lt;em&gt;insert links to quora people who tested this&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1 id=&quot;to-me-its-not-about-the-speed&quot;&gt;To me, its not about the speed&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;The primary benefit of Dvorak is its speed, I call that a nice side effect. Asa programmer, I’m writing a lot every day, and with the Querty layout, myfingertips are traveling over my keyboard more than [30 kilometers a day ], ifI want to prevent my fingers from falling off in 10 years or having a major[RSI damage], &lt;strong&gt;I better stop typing Querty now&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“NOW”? Can’t we do this later?&lt;/strong&gt;Knowing myself, and my productivity increases I will keep doing more and more work, the better would be to start now, so I don’t get stuck about it in thefuture. Or as Procastination is cancelation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“I’m tired of trying to something worthwhile for the human race, they simplydon’t want to change”- A. Dvorak in &lt;em&gt;19XX&lt;/em&gt;(citation needed)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;h1 id=&quot;colemak-is-easier-to-learn-from-querty&quot;&gt;Colemak is easier to learn from Querty&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Agreed, whenever you are already a Querty master, Dvorak will be hard to learn.Colemak will be a lot easier. I’ve been there, and already got pretty fluent inColemak in just a few hours. But statistically, Dvorak is still significantly better than any other layout.And when I’m going to invest a lot of time in this, I better do this right andwon’t give up on a minor improvement, I will go for the best thing available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1 id=&quot;how-can-dvorak-be-more-efficient&quot;&gt;How can Dvorak be more efficient?&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;### The most used keys are placed in the centerIt is designed to put the most used keys at the home row, with those keys youcan type 3000 words without moving any finger up or down on the keyboard, so I must say that feels pretty good when you’re typing. By keeping 70% of thekeystrokes on the “home row”, Dvorak reduces finger movement by a factor of 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;you-make-smarter-use-of-both-hands&quot;&gt;You make smarter use of both hands&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr Dvorak figured that you can hit more keys if you switch between your rightand left hand. So he placed the vowels on the left, and the &lt;em&gt;not vowels&lt;/em&gt; on theright. Making you use a different hand for each letter in a word. &lt;em&gt;insert graphical example&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-keys-are-designed-to-form-smarter-patterns&quot;&gt;The keys are designed to form smarter patterns&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;As you can see, the E is not placed under the index finger, but at your middlefinger. So you can easily type frequent letter combinations such as &lt;em&gt;insert combinations&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-best-way-to-learn-dvorak&quot;&gt;The best way to learn Dvorak&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;## Its about letter combinations, write real wordsBecause Dvorak is designed to be more efficient with frequent lettercombinations, I recommend to use a different learning approach than the way weused to learn Querty by typing ASDF etc. You can go to &lt;a href=&quot;http://learn.Dvorak.nl/&quot;&gt;learn.Dvorak.nl&lt;/a&gt; and get started ontheir lessons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can learn faster by not changing the prints on your keyboard or by reorderingthem. Best is to keep your Querty layout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;now-you-cant-type-normal-anymore-5-words-per-minute-for-3-weeks-long&quot;&gt;Now you can’t type normal anymore. 5 words per minute for 3 weeks long!&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have tried learning Colemak before, and gave up after 2 weeks. This won’thappen to me again!! Here is my story and I hope it will help you succeed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is where it gets tricky, and where most people drop out. You can’t typefast anymore like you used to on a Querty, you backspace on every letter youmistype, and keep on doing this over and over again for at least 3 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1 id=&quot;quickly-switching-back-and-forth-to-querty&quot;&gt;Quickly switching back and forth to Querty&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your friends and colleagues will ask you for things on the chat, but you can’tgive that rapid answer they are expecting. To prevent them on getting annoyed,answer them by voice to walk by their desks to discuss the problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In those first 2 weeks, I occasionally switched back to Querty to quickly write something in the chat, or to give a proper answer on an email. It was justundoably slow in Dvorak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To get trough this progress, I wast practicing [learn.Dvorak.nl] the entire day long, [talking about having nothing to do], also annoyed but scared to stop again. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At meetings at my work, I was the one on the projector taking public notes during the meeting, I made my notes shorter and talked around to prevent havingto struggle with the keyboard again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I didn’t do much programming during this time, I did about 15 times longer abouta task than by doing it in Querty. I only did critical bug fixes, fixed typos,or make features which were more a work of thinking, rather than a work ofwriting. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-big-jump-no-more-querty-anymore&quot;&gt;The big jump, no more Querty anymore&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;You must unlearn what you have learned         - Master Yoda&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although there are some people whom mastered both layouts, I haven’t found anysuccess stories of people who kept their Juerty skills when learning Dvorak.After 3 weeks, I had mastered Dvorak enough in order to use it in real life.I was still typing amazingly slow with 10 words per minute, but I was gettingthere. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1 id=&quot;this-is-pain-but-youre-not-alone&quot;&gt;This is pain, but you’re not alone&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wasn’t done with my online courses, but was getting so frustrated thatI still couldn’t type fluently on a Dvorak keyboard, and Googled stories ofpeople who had this experience, none was there so I promised myself I wouldwrite a story about this, which you are now reading, written on Dvorak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1 id=&quot;advancing-in-dvorak&quot;&gt;Advancing in Dvorak&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;As time goes on, you will continue to type more fluently, without typos. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1 id=&quot;dvorak-with-keyboard-shortcuts&quot;&gt;Dvorak with keyboard shortcuts&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;One annoying thing about Dvorak, is that your keyboard shortcuts are changed,you can’t do the same hand gesture anymore to copy paste something, or close awindow, and actually have to remember the command you used again. Changing the settings of this feared me with a series of domino effects withother shortcuts getting broken, and what did it matter anyways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I kept my shortcut settings unchanged, so my hands wouldn’t move too much onthe keyboard and stayed on home row position. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1 id=&quot;how-about-using-vim-with-dvorak&quot;&gt;How about using VIM with Dvorak?&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getting back to the daily programming job, I couldn’t do my favorite HJKLnavigation anymore in VIM. It frustrated me. But eventually didn’t remap any ofthe keys to Querty, so I could still use VIM on the server without needing toinstall any weird mappings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some believed that vim was designed for Querty, I only thought that hjkl wouldbecome a problem. But turns out that the JK keys are still bro’s next to eachother on the lower key row next to the Q. Y and P are now closer as well,making it easier to copypaste.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I would re-learn how to do VIM in Dvorak, like any other keyboard shortcut, youhave to think again about the letter combinations. I started to use the arrowkeys again, as a temp work around, and now find myself using the jk buttonsmore. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m not using the HL keys for horizontal navigation yet, I don’t evenknow where they are in my head, and I’m glad about that. This means I write thekeys more based on a reflex in my brain when I think about a word, than to typethem based on a set of letters I want to type.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1 id=&quot;how-to-type-at-coworkers-and-friends-keyboards&quot;&gt;How to type at coworkers and friends keyboards?&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the most common excuse I hear from people who don’t like typing inDvorak. I acknowledge it as a problem, so I don’t type on other people’s keyboardanymore with these perfect workarounds:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;activate-the-dvorak-keyboard-layout-on-their-computer&quot;&gt;Activate the Dvorak keyboard layout on their computer&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;My co-programmers at Owlin are not fond of me making changes to their system.But whenever I need to help out my girlfriend at home, I switch to Dvorak on her computer, which I configured with a keyboard shortcut. Dvorak is bydefault installed on Windows, OS X and Linux.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;use-the-build-in-dvorak-output-on-the-wasd-keyboard&quot;&gt;Use the build in Dvorak output on the WASD keyboard.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To quickly work on someone’s code at the office, I plug in my WASD keyboard andhave the buttons configured to act like a Querty keyboard to the computer,while having the buttons aligned in Dvorak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;collaborate-on-a-screen-session-via-ssh&quot;&gt;Collaborate on a screen session via SSH&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is my favorite Because I use a custom version of Dvorak, therefor I prefer to use my own computer, with [it’s own key repeat settings], and login remotely(often at a server at the office) via SSH, start a screen session on the serverwith &lt;code&gt;screen -S richard&lt;/code&gt; and ask the fellow programmer to join me with ‘screen -x richard’. He can see what I’m doing on his screen while we walktrough the code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1 id=&quot;at-last-an-apology-to-my-parents&quot;&gt;At last; an apology to my parents&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sorry mom and dad, I know that back in the days when I was 12, you had send meto a Querty typing class, paid a lot of money for it and drove me there to thecity every time. Querty has been a meaningful friend to me to become moreadvanced in computer science. But it has reached it’s limits.&lt;/p&gt;",
